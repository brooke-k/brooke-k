### ‚ú® Hi There! ‚ú® 
#### I'm Brooke Kindleman, a glitter-loving Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary

 üëã My pronouns are she/they


 üåª I'm passionate about using software as a tool for increasing accessability to knowledge for folks from all walks of life. Moving technology forward means making sure that everyone has the tools to keep up - I want to be part of that shift and am always looking for ways to learn from others and support the great people working around me. 

 üë©‚Äçüíª You can find me working up and down the development stack, but I excel at low-level languages and am most at home in C and C++, in addition to writing bash-scripts on Windows and Ubunutu to make daily life a bit easier.
